# MyTypist — Features & Product Handbook

## 6. User Flows & Workflows

This section provides detailed, narrative descriptions of how different users interact with MyTypist in real-world scenarios. Each workflow is explained from the user's perspective, highlighting the system's intelligence and efficiency.

### Single Document Processing

Follow a user's journey through the basic document creation process:

#### 1. Document Selection
The user experience begins at mytypist.net:

1. **Landing and Search**
   - User arrives at mytypist.net
   - Uses smart search with auto-complete suggestions
   - System shows grouped suggestions (e.g., "Acceptance Letter" shows all variants)
   - Preview thumbnails display template options

2. **Template Preview**

1. **Initial Form Display**
   - System groups related fields logically
   - Pre-fills known information from user profile
   - Shows progress indicator
   - Explains required vs. optional fields

2. **Intelligent Assistance**

   - Format suggestions (e.g., proper date formats)
   - Auto-capitalization where appropriate
   - Smart address formatting

3. **Draft Management**
   - Automatic saving every 3 seconds
   - Recovery from browser crashes
   - Cross-device synchronization
   - Draft version management

#### 3. Document Generation

   - Prepares document template
   - Shows generation preview

2. **Processing**

   - Error prevention checks
   - Format preservation verification

3. **Delivery**
   - Instant preview in browser
   - Download in multiple formats
   - Email sharing options
   - Secure storage in user account

### Batch Document Processing

MyTypist's batch document processing is a sophisticated system that transforms multiple document generation into a seamless, intelligent workflow. Instead of treating each document as a separate task, the system analyzes templates holistically and presents a unified, optimized experience.

#### Intelligent Template Analysis

The system employs advanced semantic matching to understand and consolidate similar fields across different templates:

1. **Semantic Field Recognition**
   - Automatically recognizes that `{full_name}`, `{applicant_name}`, and `{student_name}` refer to the same concept
   - Preserves template-specific formatting while using unified input
   - Example: A batch of 3 templates with 15 total fields might reduce to just 8 unique inputs

2. **Smart Form Generation**
   ```
   Application Package Example:
   - Employment Contract (needs: full_name in UPPERCASE)
   - Tax Form (needs: applicant_name in Title Case)
   - ID Card (needs: name in lowercase)
   
   User sees: Single "Full Name" field
   System handles: All format variations automatically
   ```

#### Resource-Optimized Processing

The system uses intelligent resource allocation based on document complexity:

1. **Dynamic Processing Strategy**
   - For 1-3 simple documents: Parallel processing
   - For 3+ documents or complex templates: Staged processing
   - For large batches: Smart queuing with progress tracking

2. **Memory Management**
   ```
   Traditional approach:
   Template → Save to disk → Read back → Process → Save result → Read for delivery
   
   MyTypist approach:
   Template in memory → Clone for each instance → Stream directly to user
   Result: 60% reduction in I/O operations
   ```

#### User Experience Enhancements

The batch system prioritizes user efficiency through:

1. **Form Complexity Reduction**
   - Analyzes all selected templates for field overlap
   - Presents unified form with logical sections
   - Example:
     ```
     Instead of:
     Template A: name, date, address (Form 1)
     Template B: name, phone, email (Form 2)
     Template C: name, signature (Form 3)
     
     User sees:
     Common Fields: name
     Document-Specific: date, address, phone, email
     Signatures: signature
     ```

2. **Intelligent Pre-population**
   - Auto-fills known user data from profile
   - Suggests contextual defaults (current date, calculated fields)
   - Remembers frequently used values
   
3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Shows common fields first
   - Expands to template-specific fields as needed
   - Example:
     ```
     Step 1: Fill common details (name, address)
     Step 2: Expand "Employment Contract" specific fields
     Step 3: Expand "Tax Form" specific fields
     Result: Mental load reduction, fewer errors
     ```

#### Performance Optimization

The system employs multiple strategies to ensure rapid processing:

1. **Intelligent Caching**
   - Caches parsed template structures
   - Pre-loads document objects
   - Example:
     ```
     First batch with Template A: 500ms
     Subsequent batches with Template A: <100ms
     ```

2. **Predictive Processing**
   - Starts document preparation during form filling
   - Pre-processes signatures and images
   - Validates fields in real-time
   - Result: Final generation appears instant (<200ms)

3. **Smart Error Handling**
   - Processes each document independently
   - Continues batch on individual failures
   - Returns successful documents immediately
   - Example:
     ```
     Batch of 5 documents:
     4 succeed → Delivered instantly
     1 fails → Clear error message, retry option
     ```

#### Real-World Usage Examples
